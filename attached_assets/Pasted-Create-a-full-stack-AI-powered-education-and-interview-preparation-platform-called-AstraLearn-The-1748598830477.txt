Create a full-stack AI-powered education and interview preparation platform called "AstraLearn". The platform should include the following features and architecture:

🔧 TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Frontend: React.js with TailwindCSS for responsive UI (dark/light mode, animations, mobile support)
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (or Firebase Firestore if Replit DB is preferred)
- AI APIs: Use OpenAI API (for GPT-based feedback and code evaluation), optional Whisper for voice input
- Replit’s integrated IDE and hosting environment

🌟 FEATURES TO INCLUDE:

1. 🧠 Personalized Learning Dashboard:
   - User login/signup (basic auth or Firebase)
   - AI-curated question sets based on selected topics (DSA, system design, etc.)
   - Resume feedback module (text upload → GPT feedback)

2. 🤖 AI Interview Coach:
   - Simulate mock interviews
   - Record or type answers, get AI feedback on tone, clarity, relevance
   - Use OpenAI GPT to evaluate responses in real-time

3. 💻 Smart Code Editor:
   - Live coding editor (Monaco or CodeMirror)
   - AI suggestions, performance tips, and error fixes
   - Auto-evaluation of code (correctness, structure, efficiency)

4. 🧘 Stress-Free Mode:
   - Pomodoro timer
   - Embedded meditation music (via API or iframe from Calm/YouTube)
   - Focus mode: Distraction blocker

5. 📘 Real-Time TechBook:
   - Dynamic notes that update based on user learning path
   - Markdown editor + AI auto-summary of topics

6. 🌐 Remote Coding Interview Room:
   - Collaborative coding environment (basic version with shared code space)
   - Interviewer view + candidate code + chat

🧩 Additional Requirements:
- Modular architecture (split by components, services, utils)
- Use environment variables for all API keys
- Design for scalability (support 10 to 10,000+ users)
- Cloud-ready: deployable on Render or Vercel
- Basic analytics: track time spent per feature/module

📦 OPTIONAL MONETIZATION:
- Freemium mode toggle (disable premium tools unless plan = 'pro')
- Admin panel for managing institutions and licenses

🎨 UI/UX:
- Visually rich dashboard
- Toggle for dark/light mode
- Mobile-first responsive design

⚙️ OUTPUT:
- Full working project scaffold with stubbed AI integrations
- Sample user flows: sign in → choose topic → learn → mock interview → code test
- Suggestions for API keys and environment setup
- Deploy instructions for Replit
